## :book: About the project

<em>Summary</em>: The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf(). You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments.

<em>Goals</em>: You will discover a popular and versatile C function: printf(). This exercise is a great opportunity to improve your programming skills. It is of moderate difficulty. You will discover variadic functions in C. The key to a successful ft_printf is a well-structured and extensible code.

<em>Task</em>: You have to recode the printf() function from libc.

The prototype of ft_printf() is:
```c
int ft_printf(const char *, ...);
```

Project requirements:

- Donâ€™t implement the buffer management of the original printf().
- Your function has to handle the following conversions: cspdiuxX%
- Your function will be compared against the original printf().
- You must use the command ar to create your library.
Using the libtool command is forbidden.
- Your libftprintf.a has to be created at the root of your repository.

## Usage

To use the `ft_printf` library, follow the steps below:

### :computer: Requirements

- `gcc` compiler

### :hammer_and_wrench: Building

1. Clone the repository that contains the `ft_printf` project.
2. Navigate to the root of the repository in your terminal.
3. Run the `make` command to compile the project and create the `libftprintf.a` library.

### :runner: Running

1. After successfully building the project, you can include the `libftprintf.a` library in your own C program.
2. In your C program, include the header file `ft_printf.h` to access the `ft_printf` function.
3. Use the `ft_printf` function in your code, providing the desired format string and any additional arguments.

Here's an example of how to use `ft_printf` in a C program:

```c
#include "ft_printf.h"

int main() {
    ft_printf("Hello, %s!\n", "world");
    ft_printf("The answer is %d\n", 42);
    return 0;
}
```
